# Internet of Things Course
## By Sir Mooazam 

In this course we will cover Introduction and Basics of IOT then we will move onto Programming of Python, after it we will move forward on C++ programming for Arduino hardware, after having strong grip of sensors and hardwares with Arduino we will move on ESP8266 and ESP32 Programming with ThingSpeak, IFTTT, Blynk Cloud and making dashboards, accompanied with it we will also learn website development part for controlling and monitoring the IOT systems. After having string grip on the above its time for Raspberry PI. At the end we will make several IOT systems to practice the learning.
